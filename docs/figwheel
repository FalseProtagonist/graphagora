what does figwheel do? => test with chestnut

=>strip out functionality:
        [put in hardcoded script]
    ->needed to rearrange script order!
    still not working, 
    thought reload-ns  might be to blame. Getting ws disconnects. not reaload-ns as chestnut functions without it.
    is it the specific function?
doesn't seem so
    is it having a single ns?
